# Darkbulb
Darkbulb is a Discord bot that scrapes the Riot Career page to see any changes in status (addition or removal of jobs)

There are 3 json files used by the bot: 
- channels_config, which stores the channel ID for bot output for every guild ID (Discord server ID)
- config.json, which stores the token for the bot
- careers.json, whichs stores the job ID as a key and job info as subfields


# Building the Bot
The bot uses a file called "config.json" (not uploaded) that will contain your Discord bot token with key "TOKEN".
